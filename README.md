### Project Solution:
_Include a comprehensive summary of all important information about your project solution here._

The folder **WQ24_Final_Project** contains all the essential materials related to our final project on Quantum Machine Learning (QML), including Jupyter notebooks, a video presentation, and supporting documents.
This project explores various quantum machine learning techniques using the Pennylane library. The project is structured across several tasks, each focusing on different aspects of quantum computing and machine learning.

**Repository Contents**
**Notebooks:**

**Task 1: Introduction to Quantum Computing Using Pennylane**

An introductory notebook covering the basics of quantum computing, demonstrating simple quantum circuits using the Pennylane framework.

**Task 2: Variational Classifier**

This notebook delves into the implementation of a variational quantum classifier, highlighting its potential for solving classification problems.

**Task 3: Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN)**

Focused on developing and training a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network, this notebook explores how QCNNs can be utilized for image classification tasks(Iris dataset).

**Task 4: Quantum Algorithm for Learning the Sine Function**

In this notebook, we implement a quantum algorithm to learn the sine function over the interval [0,2π]. The approach showcases the power of quantum algorithms in function approximation.

**Task 5: QCNN Application on Real-World Dataset**

The final task notebook applies the QCNN model to a real-world dataset, specifically focusing on defect detection in industrial production. This notebook serves as a practical example of how quantum machine learning can be applied to solve complex problems in industry.

**Video Presentation:**

A video presentation summarizing the entire project, including methodology, results, and future work. The video link is also provided within the accompanying documents.

**PowerPoint Presentation:**

A PowerPoint document that complements the video presentation, providing a visual overview of the project’s objectives, approach, and findings.

**Exploration**

To explore the project, start by reviewing the Jupyter notebooks in sequential order, from Task 1 to Task 5. Each notebook builds upon the concepts introduced in the previous ones. The video and PowerPoint presentations are included for a high-level overview and summary of the project.

All necessary code files and any additional information required to judge your project solution should be included in the repository.
